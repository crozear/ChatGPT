# Development Setup

To run the local development server:

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Start the Vite dev server with `npm run dev`.

The dev server is preconfigured to listen on `0.0.0.0:1111`, so you can open the printed URL (for example, `http://127.0.0.1:1111/`) directly in your browser outside of the container.
